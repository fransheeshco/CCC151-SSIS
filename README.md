### **1. Clone the Repository**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gabnash05/CCC151-SSIS.git
cd CCC151-SSIS
```
### **2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

```sh
python -m venv ssis_env
```

### **3. Activate the Virtual Environment**

- **Windows Command Prompt:**
  ```sh
  ssis_env\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **Windows Powershell:**
  ```sh
  .\ssis_env\Scripts\Activate
  ```

- **Linux/macOS:**
  ```sh

<br><br>

## **ðŸ”¹ Running the Project**

Make sure the virtual environment is activated and all dependencies were installed properly
```sh
python src/main.py
```
---
<br><br>

## **ðŸ”¹ Deactivating the Virtual Environment**

When you're done working, deactivate the virtual environment:
```sh
deactivate
```

<br><br>

## **ðŸ”¹ Troubleshooting**

If `pip install -e .` fails, try manually installing dependencies using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `pip install -r requirements.txt` fails, try updating `pip`:
```sh
pip install --upgrade pip
```

(Optional) If you want to see if all modules are working properly, you can **Run Tests**:
```sh
